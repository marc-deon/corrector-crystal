# Shoto

A- Jab, low jab
B- Poke, Sweep

- α: The purpose of regular fireballs is to control space, to make the opponent jump (or stand block). So air fireballs should force opponent to land? Maybe 22 or 下D could be a universal? Or, it could be an 8way airdash, and the pixie gets an air "roll" instead that goes through projectiles. [α] maybe changes the speed.

- β: DP on ground, tatsu in air.
